This is a new climate classification inspired by the Koppen system.

It is generally more granular and includes more edge cases than the Koppen system.

This method produces hundreds of possible climates; many of which are hypothetical.

This system has the advantage of the ability to accuratly describe hypothetical climates which may occur in the future due to climate change.

This could be useful in the future as humans continue to warm the earth with fossil fuels.

This system, being more generally more granular in many ways than the Koppen, better illustrates the differences between each of the new extreme climates we will see in the future.

This could even have importance in determining habitability in high emissions (in other words, realistic) warming scenarios.

This system also, because of its edge cases, illustrates some intresting climate factors that may not be obvious on the Koppen.

Each climate is measured with 3 letters.

The first letter measures climate zones by measuring the average temperature of the coldest month in Celsius.

X = Uninhabitable. 40+ (hypothetical)

Z = Ultratropical. 30 - 40 (hypothetical)

A = Supertropical. 20 - 30

B = Tropical. 10 - 20

C = Subtropical. 0 - 10

D = Temperate. -10 - 0

E = Continental. -20 - -10

F = Subarctic. -30 - -20

G = Arctic. -40 - -30

Y = Superarctic. Below -40

The second letter measures aridity zones.

In my system, the lettering of the aridity zones is as follows:

H = Humid

G = Semihumid

M = Meditterranean (If not arid desert and if < 35% of percipitation falls in the warm half of the year)

W = Monsoon (If not arid desert and if ≥ 80% of percipitation falls in the warm half of the year)

S = Semiarid

D = Arid Desert

Aridity does not appear to be relevant to the classification of climates that fall withiin subarctic, arctic, superarctic, cold summer, very cold summer, freezing summer, or frigid summer zones.

Climate classifications that fall within these zones are not measured by aridity.

The third letter measures the severity of the summers by measuring the average temperature of the warmest month in Celsius.

X3, X4,... et cetera = Extreme Wasteland. 50+ (hypothetical)

X2 = Extreme Wasteland. 45 - 50

X1 = Wasteland. 40 - 45

Z2 = Very Hot Summer. 35 - 40

Z1 = Hot Summer. 30 - 35

A2 = Very Warm Summer. 25 - 30

A1 = Warm Summer. 20 - 25

B2 = Cool Summer. 15 - 20

B1 = Cold summer. 10 - 15

C2 = Very Cold Summer. 5 - 10

C1 = Freezing Summer. 0 - 5

Y = Frigid Summer. Below 0

Here are some examples of these zones.
