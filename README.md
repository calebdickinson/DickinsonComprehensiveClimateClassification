This is a new climate classification inspired by the Koppen system.

It is generally more granular and includes more edge cases than the Koppen system.

This system also has the advantage of including more exotic climates which might be useful in the future as humans continue to warm the earth with fossil fuels.

One of these exotic summer zones, wasteland, already exists in the sahara and in a sliver of the American southwest.

We expect to see many more areas to fall under this climate in the future as global warming continues.

This system, being more granular in many ways than the Koppen, better illustrates the differences between each of the new exotic climates we will see in the future.

This could even have importance in determining habitability in extreme (in other words, realistic) warming scenarios.

This system also, because of it's edge cases, illustrates some intresting climate factors that may not be obvious on the Koppen.

For example, why do people live in greenland when a place like Nuuk, Greenland is an ET or tundra climate on the Koppen scale?

In our system, Nuuk, Greenland, is considered temperate with mild summers.

This means that the average temperature of the coldest month is between 10 and 30 degrees Fahrenheit (sue me).

The average temperature of the warmest month is between 50 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit.
In the Koppen climate this would be included in the same climate (ET) as a Siberian wasteland that has average winter temperatures of negative 50 degrees F.
Each climate is measured with 3 letters.
Exotic zones are indicated by the letters X, Y, or Z.
The first letter measures climate zones by measuring the average temperature of the coldest month in Fahrenheit.
Z = Ultratropical. 90+ (As far as I am aware, no climates currently exist within this zone... yet)
A = Supertropical. 70 - 90
B = Tropical. 50 - 70
C = Subtropical. 30 - 50
D = Temperate. 10 - 30
E = Continental. -10 - 10
F = Subarctic. -30 - -10
G = Arctic. -50 - -30
Y = Superarctic. Below -50 (This is currenly the most common exotic zone and is only found in parts of Siberia and throughout much of Antarctica)
The second letter measures aridity zones.
Aridity zones are measured in exactly the same way as in the Koppen climate, with one exception.
From Wikipedia: "The precipitation threshold in millimeters is determined by multiplying the average annual temperature in Celsius by 20, then adding:
280 if 70% or more of the total precipitation is in the spring and summer months (April–September in the Northern Hemisphere, or October–March in the Southern), or
140 if 30%–70% of the total precipitation is received during the spring and summer, or 0 if less than 30% of the total precipitation is received during the spring and summer.
If the annual precipitation is less than 50% of this threshold, the classification is BW (arid: desert climate); 
if it is in the range of 50%–100% of the threshold, the classification is BS (semi-arid: steppe climate)."
Due to significant vegetation differences that occur based on whether the aridity threshold is above or below 300%, I divided the humid zone into two zones.
Semihumid is calculated as being in the range of between 100%-300% of the aridity threshold, and humid is calculated as exceeding 300% of the aridity threshold.
In my system, the lettering of the aridity zones is as follows:
H = Humid
G = Semihumid
M = Meditterranean (Significantly Dry Summers & Significantly Wet Winters)
O = Monsoon (Significantly Wet Summers & Significantly Dry Winters)
S = Semiarid
D = Arid (Desert)
Unfortunately, when I try to add monsoon or mediterranean zones, I crash the program, so I'm still working on that.
For now, my map of aridity zones only shows H, G, S, and D zones.
The third letter measures the severity of the summers by measuring the average temperature of the warmest month in Fahrenheit.
X = Wasteland. 110+
Z = Very Hot Summer. 90 - 110 (technically not an exotic zone, but a summer of this type is horrible and full of suffocating heat)
A = Hot Summer. 70 - 90
B = Mild Summer. 50 - 70
C = Cold summer. 30 - 50
D = Very Cold Summer. 10 - 30
Y = Frigid Summer. Below 10
I may decide to futher differentiate the summer zones.
After all, summers at the lower end of a zone such as Hot Summer (zone A) are relatively mild and summers at the higher end are quite dreadful.
If I did this, I might change the summer zone system to X, A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, C2, D1, D2, and Y.
Maybe I could do Wasteland, Horribly Hot, Very Hot, Hot, Somewhat Hot, Warm Mild, Cool Mild, Somewhat Cold, Cold, Very Cold, Freezing Summer (literally, in this case), and Frigid Summer.
