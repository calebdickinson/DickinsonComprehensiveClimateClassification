# DICKINSON COMPREHENSIVE CLIMATE CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM

# How to run the code

To run code, open two Earth Engine Code Editor windows.

Paste the full code of the the most up to date versions, AllVersionsTogetherVersion_2, and 2100AllVersionsTogetherVersion_2 seperately in New Script boxes of each of the windows.

Click the "run" button.

This will generate a current climate map and a map of the climate as it is projected to be in the year 2100 given NASA's RCP8.5 "business as usual" global warming/climate change projections.

All locations on the maps are organized and color-coded according to the Dickinson Comprehensive Climate Classification System, which is explained below in the README.

Clicking on any location of the map will result in the climate classification being shown directly below the "Click map for classification" on the bottom right.

Some of these functionalities and category displays may take some time to load.

You can also filter by climate codes using the bottom right dropdown menu.

Anyone with a basic knowledge of programming could make their own versions of the code by editing to add more cities to the cityList that is displayed in the graph to the top right.

As of this writing, the cityList begins on line 411 of 2100AllVersionsTogetherVersion_2 and line 365 of AllVersionsTogetherVersion_2.

Keep in mind that due to the limitations of the resolution of the data, some small remote islands and/or extremely mountainous areas may not be exactly rendered according to their true classification.

If a different range of years are desired, some simple editing of the first couple lines of the code will generate those years instead, if they are included in the NASA/NEX-GDDP or ECMWF/ERA5 datasets.

# The Dickinson Comprehensive Climate Classification System explained

This is a new climate classification inspired by the Koppen system.

It is generally more granular and includes more edge cases than the Koppen system.

This method produces hundreds of possible climates; many of which are hypothetical.

This system has the advantage of the ability to accuratly describe hypothetical climates which may occur in the future due to climate change.

This could be useful in the future as humans continue to warm the earth with fossil fuels.

This system, being more generally more granular in many ways than the Koppen, better illustrates the differences between each of the new extreme climates we will see in the future.

This could even have importance in determining habitability in high emissions (in other words, realistic) warming scenarios.

This system also, because of its edge cases, illustrates some intresting climate factors that may not be obvious on the Koppen.

Each climate is measured with 3 letters.

The first letter measures climate zones by measuring the average temperature of the coldest month in Celsius.

X = Uninhabitable. 40+ (hypothetical)

Z = Ultratropical. 30 - 40 (hypothetical)

A = Supertropical. 20 - 30

B = Tropical. 10 - 20

C = Subtropical. 0 - 10

D = Temperate. -10 - 0

E = Continental. -20 - -10

F = Subarctic. -30 - -20

G = Arctic. -40 - -30

Y = Superarctic. Below -40

The second letter measures aridity zones.

In my system, the lettering of the aridity zones is as follows:

H = Humid

G = Semihumid

M = Meditterranean (If not arid desert and if < 35% of percipitation falls in the warm half of the year)

W = Monsoon (If not arid desert and if ≥ 80% of percipitation falls in the warm half of the year)

S = Semiarid

D = Arid Desert

Aridity does not appear to be relevant to the classification of climates that fall withiin subarctic, arctic, superarctic, cold summer, very cold summer, freezing summer, or frigid summer zones.

Climate classifications that fall within these zones are not measured by aridity.

The third letter measures the severity of the summers by measuring the average temperature of the warmest month in Celsius.

X1, X2, X3,... et cetera = Extreme Hyperthermal Summer. 40+ (X3 and above are hypothetical climates)

Z2 = Hyperthermal Summer. 35 - 40

Z1 = Scorching Hot Summer. 30 - 35

A2 = Very Hot Summer. 25 - 30

A1 = Hot Summer. 20 - 25

B2 = Mild Summer. 15 - 20

B1 = Cold summer. 10 - 15

C2 = Very Cold Summer. 5 - 10

C1 = Freezing Summer. 0 - 5

Y = Frigid Summer. Below 0
