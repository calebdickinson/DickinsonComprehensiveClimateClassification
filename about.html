    <p>This is a new climate classification inspired by the Koppen system that was created and developed by Caleb Dickinson.</p>
    <p>This system produces hundreds of possible climates; many of which are hypothetical.</p>
    <p>This system has the advantage of the ability to accuratly describe hypothetical climates which may occur in the future due to climate change.</p>
    <p>This could be useful in the future as humans continue to warm the earth with fossil fuels.</p>
    <p>This system, being more generally more granular than the Koppen, better illustrates the differences between each of the new extreme climates we will see in the future, as well as the climates we see today</p>
    <p>This system, because of its edge cases, illustrates some intresting climate factors that may not be obvious or even communicated in the Koppen system.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Each climate is measured with 2 or 3 parts, depending if the climate is is classified by aridity.</p>
    <p>The first part measures climate zones by measuring the average temperature of the coldest month in Celsius.</p>
    <p>H = Hypercaneal. 50 and above (hypothetical)</p>
    <p>X = Uninhabitable. 40 - 50 (hypothetical)</p>
    <p>Z = Ultratropical. 30 - 40 (hypothetical)</p>
    <p>A = Supertropical. 20 - 30</p>
    <p>B = Tropical. 10 - 20</p>
    <p>C = Subtropical. 0 - 10</p>
    <p>D = Temperate. -10 - 0</p>
    <p>E = Continental. -20 - -10</p>
    <p>F = Subarctic. -30 - -20</p>
    <p>G = Arctic. -40 - -30</p>
    <p>Y = Superarctic. Below -40</p>
    <br>
    <p>The second part measures aridity zones.</p>
    <p>Aridity zones are measured using evapotraspiration.</p>
    <p>To see the exact method we used to determine aridity zones, please visit the Classification page of this website.</p>
    <p>The differences in ratios between mediterranean and monsoon may seem strange until you consider that evaporation rates are higher in the warmer months, therefore, the reason for a difference between these ratios (and their corresponding vegetation zones) is intuitive if you really think about it.</p>
    <p>Aridity does not appear to be relevant to the classification of climates that fall within subarctic, arctic, superarctic, cold summer, very cold summer, freezing summer, or frigid summer zones.</p>
    <p>Climate classifications that fall within these zones are not measured by aridity.</p>
    <p>H = Humid</p>
    <p>G = Semihumid</p>
    <p>W = Monsoon (If not arid desert and if > 80% of percipitation falls in the sunniest half of the year)</p>
    <p>M = Mediterranean (If not arid desert and if < 40% of percipitation falls in the sunniest half of the year)</p>
    <p>S = Semiarid</p>
    <p>D = Arid Desert</p>
    <br>
    <p>The third part measures the severity of the summers by measuring the average temperature of the warmest month in Celsius.</p>
    <p>H = Hypercaneal Summer. 50 and above (hypothetical)</p>
    <p>X = Hyperthermal Summer. 40 - 50</p>
    <p>Z2 = Hyperthermal Summer. 35 - 40</p>
    <p>Z1 = Scorching Hot Summer. 30 - 35</p>
    <p>A2 = Very Hot Summer. 25 - 30</p>
    <p>A1 = Hot Summer. 20 - 25</p>
    <p>B2 = Mild Summer. 15 - 20</p>  
    <p>B1 = Cold summer. 10 - 15</p>
    <p>C2 = Very Cold Summer. 5 - 10</p>
